The local government has already started shipping out vaccination vouchers for the booster, but they're slotted to be mailed in waves based on when you received your last shot. You -must- have your voucher to make a booster reservation.\
E.g. if your last shot was between August 8th and August 21st, 2021, your voucher will be mailed on February 3rd, 2022.\
\
**Note:** The Itabashi City website strongly cautions against getting your booster early. They clearly state that doing so will mean you cannot receive your vaccination paperwork (e.g. your vaccination passport, if you have one), as well as result in a bill for the vaccination being sent to you.\
