# Welcome to Find a Doc

Find a Doc is an open source project dedicated to gathering and sharing health related information and services in Japan.

Anyone can [**become a contributor**](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/Hmir5Cugknp7uJaXBpz1/94vH2CSObJutobSAA9Ft) to Find a Doc. We rely on people like you to help keep the foreign community in Japan up to date with the latest healthcare information.

Think of this as a wiki that will (hopefully) grow over time as more people get involved and contribute. :tada:
