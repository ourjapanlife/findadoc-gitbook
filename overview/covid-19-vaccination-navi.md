#### Online Vaccinations Via COVID-19 Vaccination Navi

[https://v-sys.mhlw.go.jp/en/](https://v-sys.mhlw.go.jp/en/)

Online reservations are available through COVID-19 Vaccine Navi (linked above). Their website isn't exhaustive, but allows you to make online reservations with government-sponsored sites. If navigating the page in English:\
\- Select "Search Vaccination Sites" -> Your Prefecture -> Your Area\
\- Scroll down for the list of vaccination locations. (Addresses and names will likely not be in English.)\
\- Next to the location you'd like to reserve with, select the + button to open the drop-down menu for that location's reservation options. Some only allow reservations by phone, rather than online.\
\- Click "to Reservation page" if the location is compatible with online reservations.\
\- You will need your voucher number in hand to complete the reservation.
